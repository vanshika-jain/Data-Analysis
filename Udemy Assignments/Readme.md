As a part of Python practice, I subscribed to Udemy's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp. This folder contains various assignments through the course. All the assignments have a stepwise approach.
The course takes you through a beginner level to advance level questions. It gives in depth knowledge of data wrangling libraries of numpy, pandas and data visualization libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pyplot, cufflinks, etc.

##Ecommerce Purchases exercise:

It is majorly an introduction to pandas libraries and various functions that can be used for indexing and searching

##911 Data Capstone Project:

At the end of the Python introduction, the tutorial challenges you for analysis of Kaggle 911 dataset. Questions include string processing, data cleaning, visualization, etc.


*I have not uploaded the solved section wise assignments as those were part of practice.
